# Real-time Conversation and Notification Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **WebSocket Initialization Issue**
- **Problem**: WebSocket wasn't initializing when user was already authenticated (page refresh)
- **Fix**: Added WebSocket initialization in `AppComponent` and `ChatContainerComponent`

### 2. **Conversation Name Display**
- **Problem**: Participants weren't included in conversation DTOs
- **Fix**: Updated `convertToDto` method to include participants

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- **Problem**: WebSocket listeners had issues with state management
- **Fix**: Enhanced conversation state management and WebSocket error handling

### 4. **Notification Count Updates**
- **Problem**: Notification counts weren't being sent when conversations were created
- **Fix**: Added notification count updates in conversation creation endpoints

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check WebSocket Connection
1. Open browser console
2. Login to the application
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔐 User already authenticated, initializing WebSocket...
   🔐 Initializing WebSocket connection, token available: true
   🔐 Token found, initializing connection...
   🔌 Initializing WebSocket connection...
   🔌 Creating SockJS connection to: http://localhost:8080/ws
   ✅ WebSocket connected successfully
   ```

### Step 2: Test Conversation Creation
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Login with different users in each
3. Create a conversation from one user
4. Check the other user's conversation list immediately
5. Verify:
   - Conversation appears immediately
   - Conversation name shows correctly (sender sees receiver name, receiver sees sender name)
   - Notification count updates

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
1. Monitor backend logs for these messages:
   ```
   Creating private conversation between [userId1] and [userId2]
   Sending conversation update to userId=[userId]
   ✅ Successfully sent conversation update to user [userId]
   ✅ Successfully sent unread count update to user [userId]: [count]
   ```

### Step 4: Check Frontend Logs
1. Monitor browser console for these messages:
   ```
   🔍 Setting up conversation updates listener...
   🔍 Subscribing to conversation updates at /user/queue/conversation-updates
   ✅ Conversation updates subscription created
   📨 Received conversation update message: [message]
   ✅ Parsed conversation update: [data]
   Received new conversation via WebSocket: [conversation]
   ```

### Step 5: Test Notification Bell
1. Create a conversation
2. Check notification bell count updates
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Setting up unread count listener...
   🔍 Subscribing to unread count updates at /user/queue/unread-count
   ✅ Unread count subscription created
   📨 Received unread count message: [count]
   ✅ Parsed unread count: [count]
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Working Features:
- **Immediate Conversation Updates**: New conversations appear instantly for all participants
- **Correct Conversation Names**: Sender sees receiver name, receiver sees sender name
- **Real-time Notification Counts**: Notification bell updates immediately
- **WebSocket Stability**: Connection remains stable with proper error handling

### 🔍 Debugging Tips:

1. **If WebSocket doesn't connect**:
   - Check if user is authenticated
   - Look for token availability in console
   - Verify backend is running on correct port

2. **If conversations don't appear**:
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Verify conversation creation logs in backend
   - Check frontend subscription logs

3. **If notification count doesn't update**:
   - Check unread count subscription logs
   - Verify backend notification service logs
   - Check WebSocket message delivery

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `ConversationServiceImpl.java` - Fixed participant inclusion
- `ConversationController.java` - Added detailed logging and error handling
- `NotificationServiceImpl.java` - Enhanced error handling

### Frontend:
- `AppComponent.ts` - Added WebSocket initialization
- `ChatContainerComponent.ts` - Added WebSocket initialization
- `WebSocketService.ts` - Enhanced logging and error handling
- `ChatStateService.ts` - Improved conversation state management
- `ConversationListComponent.ts` - Added conversation update subscription

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**:
   - Check if backend is running on port 8080
   - Verify CORS settings
   - Check authentication token

2. **Conversations Not Updating**:
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Verify subscription to conversation updates
   - Check backend logs for message sending

3. **Notification Count Not Updating**:
   - Check unread count subscription
   - Verify notification service integration
   - Check WebSocket message delivery

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/application.log

# Check WebSocket connection in browser
# Open DevTools > Console and look for WebSocket logs
```

This should resolve the real-time conversation updates and notification count issues. Test thoroughly and monitor the logs to ensure everything is working correctly.
